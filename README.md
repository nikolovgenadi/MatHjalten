# MatHj√§lten

Used AI and tutorials online in order to get a quick structure and templates for starting files such as file/folder structure in project and vite/react files, which were later configured by me with the actual code.  
Consulted with AI during the project to avoid missing any vital steps in my plan and process as well as troubleshooting/error handling.
