# MatHjälten

is a full-stack Progressive Web Application (PWA) built to reduce food waste by letting users share surplus food instead of throwing it away.
Users can register, log in, create ads for food/drinks, upload images, browse and filter available items, reserve offers, and manage their own ads.
The UI is mobile-first and the app can be installed directly from the browser as a PWA.
